All out of partials to extend? Tired of the same blank search? Try ibs! ibs is a Golly script used to find seeds for ikpx2 searches.

1. Get ikpx2
2. Get Golly
3. Configure the script's options**
4. Open Golly
5. Select a bounding box (10x10 is what I use)
6. Run the script through Golly

Notes: Run this in a linux environment. You may need to hack ikpx2 to prevent it from outputting its banner if ibs is too slow.

**The decisionWidth and maxWidth are key to configure. You will want to experiment with what works for each velocity.
